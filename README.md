# Automating-Email-Classification
Managing emails is one of the essential tasks in any organization. The time-sensitive emails should
be categorized in a way that they should be dealt with first rather than prioritizing them in the order
they are received. Nowadays, our inbox is cluttered with a variety of emails like newsletters and
other promotional offers which hinders the high-priority emails, and as a result, the employees
find it difficult to meet their deadlines. Self-sorting & labeling is stressful work.
The outlook has an existing feature of customizing the labels and classifying the emails which is
a tedious job as they must think about all types of emails. The employees working in the
organization must manually enter the keywords for labeling and they have to be in a specific 
sequence for the classification to work. Students seeking admission are from around the globe,
where English is not their first language. Their way of composing emails might differ from the
standard way in the USA. Thus, we need a system that can help the employees working in the
Graduate Admission office to overcome those issues. Is there a way we can automate and selforganize the emails?
